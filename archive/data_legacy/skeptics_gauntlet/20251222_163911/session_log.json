    "text": "Fair. If I can\u2019t show an inspectable step with numbers, \u201cidentity attractor\u201d is just story. What I *did* implement is mechanistic state with logged variables: rigidity \u03c1\u2208[0,1], exploration \u03b5\u2208[0,1], drift d (embedding-distance delta vs a running self-embedding), and wound triggers w (thresholded spikes from threat-classifier + semantic distance).

In logs, when w fired, \u03c1 rose sharply, \u03b5 collapsed, and drift damped on subsequent turns\u2014consistently, without prompt templates changing. Limitation: my current intervention is a decoding-time penalty/constraint layer, not a new base-model learning algorithm. Also: I haven\u2019t preregistered suite thresholds yet; until I do ablations vs simple rerank/self-consistency under fixed budgets, the attractor framing should be treated as a control wrapper, not a proven algorithmic advance.",
