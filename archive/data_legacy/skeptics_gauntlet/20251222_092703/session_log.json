    "text": "Sam, I appreciate the directness. DDA-X isn't just rebranding; it's a genuine attempt to address how agents respond to threat using precise control-theory elements rather than traditional exploratory heuristics. The core of our innovation lies in how rigidity (\u03c1) and prediction error (\u03b5) interact via mechanisms like \"wound resonance\" and \"identity attractors\" to dynamically adjust behavior under stress. In our internal tests, these components have performed as intended, adjusting decision-making strategies based on embedding distances and state transitions. However, it's true that without external benchmarks like VisualWebArena demonstrating clear advantages, the theoretical promises remain unproven in broader contexts. If those results don't show significant benefits soon, I'll be the first to acknowledge that our approach needs reevaluation.
