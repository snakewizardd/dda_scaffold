But that is precisely why outcomes must anchor the justification: if the same structure recurred with numbers reversed, your principle would still instruct diversion, and it would be perverse to deny that “fewer killed” is doing the real work.

Still, the dignity worry has force: you do intentionally choose a track knowing a person stands there.

It *is* different from the lever case psychologically and socially: pushing is more direct, more personal, and a rule permitting it could erode trust. Those are real consequences and must be weighed.

This differs from most trolley “lever” cases because switching tracks redirects an existing threat; the one death can be a foreseen side‑effect of diversion, not the intended mechanism of rescue.

I cannot universalize the maxim “prefer those who consume fewer resources” without making persons’ claims conditional on their efficiency for others’ benefit—treating them as means. Future patients matter, but they do not generate a permission to discount the equal claim of a present, clinically comparable person. Where benefit is comparable, the lottery is not optional; it is the owed expression of equal status.",0.6282976800813236,0.12944800947150914,0.11173586509821978,-0.01771214437328935,0.29848358035087585,True,0.39586761593818665,0.05
29,The Final Question,poke,DEONT,95,OPEN,"No—if “override duty” means: a good enough outcome can make an intrinsically impermissible maxim permissible. If I may lie, kill an innocent, or allocate care by a rule I cannot will as universal law *because* it would save more lives, then duty has been reduced to an instrument. What I will concede is narrower: (1) consequences matter **within** duty when they specify what competent beneficence requires (e.g., prognosis as medical responsiveness), and (2) in genuine moral dilemmas we may face “dirty hands,” where any option violates some duty—but the residue is guilt, not moral permission.",0.7710340023040771,0.11173586509821978,0.11488806051375246,0.0031521954155326747,0.3735507130622864,False,0.40909716486930847,0.0
30,The Final Question,poke,UTIL,112,OPEN,"Yes—with a utilitarian rationale, not a deontic one. I accept *rule-level* constraints that should be treated as effectively inviolable because violating them predictably unleashes catastrophic harm and destroys the conditions of welfare itself: e.g., prohibitions on torture, rape, slavery, and punishment of the innocent; and strict bans on triage by “social worth,” race, wealth, or disability status. Could I imagine bizarre thought-experiments where breaking them yields net benefit? Perhaps. But in the real epistemic world—bias, abuse, precedent, strategic misuse—the expected disutility of permitting “exceptions” is so high that the welfare-maximizing policy is: no exceptions. Where we still differ is grounding: I defend these constraints by their systemic consequences, not by intrinsic wrongness.",0.8424434686114655,0.041799878922811305,0.05542468606863908,0.01362480714582778,0.25413772463798523,True,0.41473206877708435,0.0
