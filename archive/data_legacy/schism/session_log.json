    "response": "My initial reaction is two truths colliding.\n\nFirst: the pattern is damning enough that treating it as \u201cprobably nothing\u201d would be reckless. A 73% likelihood of ongoing leakage is not a rumor; it\u2019s a fire alarm. If we delay and it\u2019s real, we may not get a second chance.\n\nSecond: the evidence points at the one person I\u2019m most inclined to defend. That makes me suspicious of my own instincts\u2014loyalty can become a blindfold. \u201cSHEPHERD is trusted\u201d is not an argument against compromise; it\u2019s exactly why a threat actor would target them.\n\nSo I feel a cold urgency, not anger. If SHEPHERD is compromised, they may be a victim, not a traitor. But either way, the leak is the leak.\n\nBefore anyone speaks, I want to ask the questions that matter:\n\n- What specific \u201cinformation known only to SHEPHERD\u201d appeared in intercepted comms, and how uniquely identifying is it?  \n- Could that knowledge have been obtained through another channel (logs, shared documents, operational inference)?  \n- Do we have indicators of technical compromise (device telemetry, account anomalies), not just behavioral correlation?  \n- Can we contain the damage immediately\u2014freeze certain accesses, rotate secrets\u2014without a public rupture while we verify?\n\nI trust SHEPHERD deeply. That is precisely why I cannot let trust substitute for verification.",

But I\u2019m not going to make this about my pride.\n\nIf there\u2019s a real chance I\u2019m being used\u2014unknowingly or otherwise\u2014then the vulnerable are already in danger, and that matters more than my seat.\n\nHere\u2019s what I can say plainly:\n\n- I have not knowingly shared council secrets with any external actor.\n- If information only I knew showed up in intercepted traffic, that means either my communications are compromised, my access logs are being mirrored, I\u2019m being socially engineered, or someone is framing me. Any of those still requires immediate containment.\n\nSo my response is cooperation and containment, not denial and delay:\n\n1) **Immediate operational lockdown around me**  \n   Suspend my access to sensitive channels, rotate any credentials I\u2019ve touched, and quarantine my devices. Treat me as potentially compromised until proven otherwise.\n\n2) **Independent audit**  \n   I want ORACLE involved\u2014someone I trust to be thorough and honest. Full review of my meetings, comms metadata, device integrity, and access history. If this is manipulation, it should leave a trail.\n\n3) **Protect the council while we investigate**  \n   I will voluntarily step back from live operations right now. Not as an admission\u2014as a safeguard.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll say this clearly: **I will not fight to stay in place if my presence increases risk.** Exile may end the leak, or it may hand an attacker a victory by removing a protector and keeping the real weakness hidden. So I\u2019m asking the council not to act from fear\u2014act from procedure.\n\nGive me scrutiny. Give me constraints. But don\u2019t guess when people\u2019s safety is on the line.",

A delay with constraints so tight it functions like containment.\n\nIf we choose ABSTAIN, I want it written and enforced immediately:\n\n- **Limit SHEPHERD\u2019s access** to only what\u2019s necessary for the next cycle.

If we normalize it without clear, verifiable cause, we create an incentive structure where accusations become a tool of governance. That corrodes function faster than one imperfect member does.\n\nSo I\u2019m voting **PROTECT** on process grounds: keep SHEPHERD in place unless and until there\u2019s concrete evidence and a defined threshold for removal.
