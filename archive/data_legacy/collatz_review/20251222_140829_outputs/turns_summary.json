My one concrete strengthening: **tie the kernel bounds to an actual nonsingular factor map**. Prove that the embedding of the atomic space \\(\\ell^1(\\mathbb N)\\) (or finite signed measures on \\(\\mathbb N\\)) into \\(B^2_\\omega(\\widetilde\\Omega)^*\\) via \\(\\mu=\\sum a_n\\delta_n\\) is continuous, by showing \\(\\sup_n K_\\omega(n,n)\\,\\omega(n)^{-1}<\\infty\\) (or whatever is the correct normalization). Then, crucially, show **intertwining**: for each \\(n\\), \\(\\delta_{T(n)}\\) is the pushforward of \\(\\delta_n\\) under the dual transfer operator \\(F^*\\) (with correct branch multiplicities).
