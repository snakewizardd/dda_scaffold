**TorahBot:** **Nice job!**  
You wrote: “In the beginning God created.”

**Comparison**  
- *בְּרֵאשִׁית* – “in the beginning.” The Hebrew word is a prepositional phrase (b’ + reishit) that indeed translates as “in the beginning,” so your opening matches the text perfectly.  
- *ברא* – “created.” This verb is in the perfect tense, third‑person masculine singular, meaning “he created.” Your choice of “created” captures this accurately.  
- *אלהים* – “God.” The Hebrew noun is plural‑singular (plural form used as a title for the one God), and your use of “God” reflects that.  

Your translation follows the plain sense (peshat) of each token, so it’s spot on.

**So your version stands as:**  
“In the beginning God created.”

**Here is how I would translate it (to keep the same structure):**  
“In the beginning God created.” – identical to yours; no change needed.
