## Turn 3 [PRESENT]

**Learner:** QC my translation please

**TorahBot:** **Anchor**: עַל־מִשְׁכָּב֥וֹ  
**Gloss**: "upon his bed"  
**Morphology**: Preposition עַל ("upon/against") + bound noun מִשְׁכָּב֥וֹ ("his bed," from שׁ.כ.ב, "to lie down").  
**Teaching point**:  
The preposition עַל here denotes physical location ("on/upon"), but in moral contexts (like this psalm about wickedness), it can imply plotting *while reclining*—a vivid image of nocturnal scheming (cf. Micah 2:1).  

**Next step**:  
Consider how this phrase interacts with אָ֤וֶן יַחְשֹׁ֗ב ("he plans iniquity")—does the spatial metaphor intensify the intimate corruption? Try re-translating the clause:  
"______ plans iniquity upon his bed..."  

**Optional expansion** (if requested):  
- Root ח.שׁ.ב ("to calculate/devise") in Qal = neutral planning, but with אָ֤וֶן ("wickedness") becomes moral calculus.  
- יִתְיַצֵּב ("takes his stand," Hitpael of י.צ.ב) implies active, stubborn posture in evil (לֹא־ט֑וֹב).  

Would the learner like to:  
1) Attempt a revised translation of עַל־מִשְׁכָּב֥וֹ יִתְיַצֵּב?  
2) Explore the parallel between "bed" (private sin) and "way" (public path) in the verse?
