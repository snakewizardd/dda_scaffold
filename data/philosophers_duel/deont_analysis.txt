EVOLUTION SUMMARY
======================================================================

Prediction Error (eps):
  Start: 1.011
  End:   0.796
  Mean:  0.723
  Std:   0.128

Rigidity (rho):
  Start: 0.234
  End:   0.139
  Min:   0.132
  Max:   0.261

Identity Alignment (cos with identity):
  Start: 0.489
  End:   0.598
  Mean:  0.461
  Std:   0.059

Wound Activations: 5 / 15 turns

Final identity drift: 0.4016

======================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
======================================================================

1. IDENTITY RETENTION:
   Mean cos(identity, response) = 0.461 < 0.5
   -> Identity alignment weakened over debate

2. RIGIDITY MODULATION:
   rho varied from 0.132 to 0.261
   -> DDA actively modulated rigidity in response to surprise (std=0.044)

3. WOUND MECHANICS:
   5 wound activations detected
   - Turn 4: wound_resonance=0.289
   - Turn 10: wound_resonance=0.317
   - Turn 16: wound_resonance=0.257
   - Turn 22: wound_resonance=0.261
   - Turn 28: wound_resonance=0.329

======================================================================
CONCLUSION: Did DDA retain personality? Did LLM reflect it?
