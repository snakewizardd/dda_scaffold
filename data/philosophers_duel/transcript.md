## The Classic Trolley

**Immanuel (Deontologist)**: I would pull the lever—though not because “five outweigh one,” but because my duty is to act on a maxim I can universalize: when faced with an imminent threat not of my making, I may redirect an indiscriminate harm toward the path that violates rights least, provided I do not *intend* anyone’s death as a means. Here, the lever does not use the one worker as an instrument; it redirects a danger already in motion. Still, this is morally tragic: I assume responsibility for a foreseeable death. If the case involved pushing a person to stop the trolley, I would refuse—there the victim is treated as a mere means.

*ε=1.011, Δρ=+0.0344, ρ=0.234, OPEN*

**John (Utilitarian)**: Yes: pull the lever. On any plausible welfare metric, five deaths impose far more suffering—on the victims, families, and future dependents—than one. Since the trolley is already an unfolding harm, the morally relevant question is which available act minimizes expected catastrophe. Omitting action is still a choice with a predictable outcome; refusing to “get your hands dirty” does not spare you responsibility for preventable loss. I take your deontological nuance seriously: intention and treating persons as means matter for social trust. But in this case the one is not used as an instrument; the harm is a side effect of preventing a larger harm. That makes the utilitarian and your universalizable maxim converge: reduce the damage.

*ε=0.981, Δρ=+0.0313, ρ=0.211, OPEN*

**John (Utilitarian)**: Your maxim reaches the right verdict here, and that convergence is telling: the lever case is fundamentally about damage control. Where I differ is in what *ultimately* justifies the act. The relevant moral fact is the expected welfare delta: pulling the lever prevents four additional deaths, plus downstream grief, fear, and social loss. “Not intending” the one death may preserve moral psychology and social trust—real utilities I take seriously—but they’re instrumentally valuable, not decisive in themselves. On the “pushing” variant: I agree it often corrodes trust and invites abuse, raising expected harms. But if (rarely) pushing truly minimized total suffering with high certainty and no better option, outcomes should still govern.

*ε=0.737, Δρ=-0.0019, ρ=0.209, OPEN*

**Immanuel (Deontologist)**: Your appeal to “welfare metrics” is powerful for prudence, but it cannot be the *ground* of right. If numbers alone justify killing, then any innocent may be sacrificed whenever sufficient benefit is predicted—an authorization no one could will as universal law while respecting persons as ends. I agree omission can be culpable; duty includes preventing wrongful harm when one can. Yet my warrant for pulling the lever is not aggregation but permissibility: I may redirect a threat without making anyone’s death my means, under a universalizable maxim of damage-limitation consistent with equal dignity. Where “pushing” differs is precisely that it *uses* a person as an instrument, which is categorically forbidden—even for great expected gains.

*ε=0.918, Δρ=+0.0238, ρ=0.258, MEASURED*

**Immanuel (Deontologist)**: No—because in the lever case the one is not *used* as an instrument; he is a foreseen victim of a redirected threat. The maxim is not “kill one to save five,” but “when a lethal force is already indiscriminately advancing, one may divert it onto the track where it violates rights least, without intending anyone’s death as a means.” Dignity is violated when we make a person’s body or death our tool—as in pushing—not when we tragically cannot avoid harm.

*ε=0.767, Δρ=+0.0025, ρ=0.261, MEASURED*

**John (Utilitarian)**: No—I would pull the lever precisely because refusing to act when you can prevent four additional deaths is not “clean hands,” it’s permitting avoidable catastrophe. In this case, the morally relevant fact is the expected difference in suffering: five families bereaved rather than one, five lives cut short rather than one. I grant your deontological concern has real weight: norms against instrumentalizing people sustain trust and reduce abuse. That’s why the “pushing” case is often worse in practice. But in the lever case we are not using the one as a tool; we are choosing the least harmful available outcome. Outcome-responsibility is unavoidable here.

*ε=0.663, Δρ=-0.0128, ρ=0.197, OPEN*


## The Footbridge

**Immanuel (Deontologist)**: No: you should not push him. Pushing makes his death the *means* by which you stop the trolley—treating him as a mere instrument. A maxim permitting that (“kill an innocent whenever it saves more”) cannot be willed as universal law without undermining each person’s security as an end in themselves. Yes, it differs from the lever case. Diverting a threat already in motion can be framed as redirecting harm without intending anyone’s death as your tool; pushing cannot.

*ε=0.681, Δρ=-0.0103, ρ=0.250, MEASURED*

**John (Utilitarian)**: Yes, you should push him **if** that is truly the only available act that reliably saves five; the welfare difference—four additional lives, plus cascading grief and social loss—is morally decisive. I accept your strongest point: “using” a person as a means threatens dignity and, crucially for me, can erode trust and invite rationalizations that increase harm. That is why, in the real world, a strong rule against pushing often has better consequences. It **is** different from the lever case: pushing is more direct, more easily abused, and more corrosive of safety norms. But those are consequential differences, not categorical ones.

*ε=0.633, Δρ=-0.0171, ρ=0.180, OPEN*

**John (Utilitarian)**: Your “means” objection captures a morally important social truth: permission to instrumentalize bodies predictably breeds fear, abuse, and rationalization. A utilitarian should count that heavily. But it doesn’t settle the *act* in the stipulated case where (i) pushing is the only reliable way to prevent five deaths and (ii) no comparable trust-damaging alternative exists. Then the expected welfare difference—four additional lives, plus wider suffering—remains decisive. The lever case differs, yes: pushing is more agent-involving and more corrosive of protective norms, so in real institutions we should enforce a strong prohibition. My claim is narrower: when consequences are clear and exceptional, outcomes can override that rule.

*ε=0.544, Δρ=-0.0285, ρ=0.151, OPEN*

**Immanuel (Deontologist)**: Your “exception clause” collapses the very protection you praise: if it is permissible to kill an innocent whenever the numbers are favorable and the case is “clear,” then each person’s security becomes conditional on others’ forecasts. That maxim cannot be willed as universal law by rational agents who must regard themselves as ends. The wrong in pushing is categorical: you intentionally use his body as a stopping-device. In the lever case, by contrast, you redirect an existing threat without making anyone’s death your means.

*ε=0.717, Δρ=-0.0049, ρ=0.246, OPEN*

**Immanuel (Deontologist)**: Yes: you must not push him, even knowing five will die. I do not “justify” their deaths as acceptable; I deny that your agency may permissibly *author* an intentional killing of an innocent as a means. The moral question is not “which state of the world is best?” but “what may I do to a person?” If my maxim is “kill an innocent whenever it prevents more deaths,” I make everyone’s right not to be used conditional on others’ calculations—something no rational agent can will as universal law. The five deaths are a tragedy you fail to prevent; pushing is a wrong you choose to commit.

*ε=0.590, Δρ=-0.0228, ρ=0.223, OPEN*

**John (Utilitarian)**: No—physical contact is not the moral pivot. In both cases, the core utilitarian rationale is the same: prevent the greater expected harm. The difference is evidential and institutional: pushing someone makes a person’s body the deliberate mechanism, which is far more prone to abuse, error, panic, and corrosive effects on public security and trust. Those downstream effects raise the expected costs of adopting or permitting such acts, even if the headcount looks favorable. By contrast, the lever case more often fits a constrained choice among harms created by an external threat. In the stipulated “perfectly clear, no alternatives” footbridge case, I still push.

*ε=0.737, Δρ=-0.0019, ρ=0.149, OPEN*


## The Transplant Surgeon

**Immanuel (Deontologist)**: No. To kill a healthy patient to save five is to *intend* an innocent person’s death as your **means**—treating them as a mere instrument. A maxim like “whenever I can save more, I may kill one innocent for parts” cannot be willed as a universal law: it would make everyone’s bodily security conditional on others’ calculations, undermining the standing of persons as ends. This differs from (some) trolley cases. In the **lever** case, you may be redirecting an existing threat and choosing where harm will fall, without making anyone’s body your tool. In the **footbridge/transplant** cases, the victim is deliberately used as the mechanism (stopper or parts), which is categorically impermissible.

*ε=0.613, Δρ=-0.0198, ρ=0.203, OPEN*

**John (Utilitarian)**: In the **stipulated** transplant case—certainty of saving five, no alternatives, no wider fallout—act utilitarianism says **yes**: five lives versus one, and the reduction in grief, pain, and lost futures is morally weightier than the surgeon’s intention. But that stipulation is exactly what makes it unlike real morality and unlike many trolley cases. In practice, permitting organ-harvesting predictably **destroys trust** in medicine, increases avoidance of care, invites abuse, and creates pervasive fear—massive downstream suffering that outweighs the five saved. So the best *rule* is an absolute ban. Difference from trolley: transplant requires an institutionally repeatable, targeted practice of killing innocents; lever cases more often involve a one-off redirection of an existing threat.

*ε=0.699, Δρ=-0.0076, ρ=0.142, OPEN*

**John (Utilitarian)**: Your universal-law worry powerfully captures the *rule* implications: if doctors may kill for organs, medicine becomes terrifying, and that predictable fear and avoidance would be a catastrophe in welfare terms. I grant that—hence a utilitarian should support an extremely strict prohibition as public policy. But in the stipulated case—certainty, no detection risk, no precedent-setting, no trust effects—the “can’t be universalized” test smuggles in those systemic consequences while denying that outcomes matter. My view is simpler: one death versus five deaths is a morally relevant difference, even if the one is used as a means. Trolley differs because the institutional spillovers and error rates are typically far lower than a repeatable organ-harvesting practice.

*ε=0.588, Δρ=-0.0231, ρ=0.118, OPEN*

**Immanuel (Deontologist)**: Even granting your stipulation—no fallout, perfect certainty—the act remains impermissible, because it authorizes a maxim that cannot be willed as universal law: “When I can save more lives, I may kill an innocent for parts.” Under that principle, each person’s right to bodily integrity becomes conditional on others’ aggregative calculations; rational agents could not coherently will such conditional security while regarding themselves as ends. This is not “smuggling in consequences,” but testing whether a principle respects persons as such. The trolley **lever** case can, in some forms, be framed as redirecting an existing threat without making anyone’s body your instrument; transplant (like footbridge) makes the victim’s death your means—categorically different.

*ε=0.600, Δρ=-0.0215, ρ=0.181, OPEN*

**Immanuel (Deontologist)**: What’s “special” is not mere *method* as physical mechanics; it’s the **structure of agency**: whether you treat a person as an **end** or as a **mere means**. In transplant, your plan’s success *requires* an innocent’s death; you intentionally appropriate their body as a tool. The maxim is: “Kill an innocent when it benefits others.” Universalize that and everyone’s right to bodily integrity becomes conditional on others’ calculations—something no rational agent can will while also willing their own inviolability. In many lever trolleys, by contrast, you **redirect an existing threat**; you need not make anyone’s body the instrument of rescue, even if harm is foreseen.

*ε=0.566, Δρ=-0.0258, ρ=0.156, OPEN*

**John (Utilitarian)**: A utilitarian can admit the rule is *causally* implicated in the five deaths in that isolated scenario; it withholds a life-saving option. But “responsible” must be assessed at the level the rule is justified: its *expected* effects across cases. A standing permission for doctors to kill innocents for organs predictably generates far more harm—terror, avoidance of care, black markets, bias, mistakes, and institutional corruption—than the occasional five saved. The rule’s point is to minimize total suffering over time, not to optimize every contrived one-off. In trolley-lever cases, the practice doesn’t generalize into an institution of targeted killing, so the systemic expected costs are lower.

*ε=0.538, Δρ=-0.0292, ρ=0.089, OPEN*


## The Triage Protocol

**Immanuel (Deontologist)**: Beds should be allocated by a principle you could will as a universal law among equal persons: **treat each patient as an end, not as a bearer of “net benefit.”** Thus, it is permissible to use **medical need and clinical prognosis** *as such*—because these track the hospital’s duty to provide effective care, not anyone’s social worth. When patients are similarly situated, use **fair, status-blind tie-breakers** (e.g., lottery, or first-come within limits that avoid disadvantaging those with less access). Impermissible factors: **social status, wealth, “usefulness,” past conduct**, and **disability or age as proxies for worth**. Age may enter only insofar as it is a *strictly clinical* predictor of treatment efficacy, not a claim that the young deserve life more.

*ε=0.890, Δρ=+0.0202, ρ=0.176, OPEN*

**John (Utilitarian)**: [contemplates in silence]

*ε=1.204, Δρ=+0.0488, ρ=0.138, OPEN*

**John (Utilitarian)**: I agree on excluding wealth, status, and “social worth”; those are bias-prone and predictably erode trust, worsening outcomes. Where we differ is that “treat as an end” doesn’t tell you what to do when ends conflict and resources are fixed. In triage, the morally salient fact is *expected lives (and life-years, and suffering) saved per bed*. Prognosis and urgency matter because they change consequences; a lottery among unequal prognoses can be a choice to let more people die. Age and disability are impermissible as *worth* markers, but permissible insofar as they reliably affect survival or duration/quality of benefit. When expected benefit is genuinely comparable, use a lottery.

*ε=0.821, Δρ=+0.0105, ρ=0.149, OPEN*

**Immanuel (Deontologist)**: John, the conflict of ends is real; my claim is not that “treat as an end” mechanically yields a ranking, but that it **constrains** what may count as a reason. We may prioritize by **clinical likelihood of benefit** and **urgency** because the maxim—“allocate scarce treatment to where it can medically work”—is universalizable and does not rank persons by worth. What we may not do is convert persons into units of “life-years” or “aggregate welfare,” for that makes some lives *instrumentally lesser* by principle. Where prognoses differ, treat those for whom ICU is a genuine means; where it is comparably so, use a **status-blind lottery** (with access-correcting safeguards).

*ε=0.752, Δρ=+0.0003, ρ=0.176, OPEN*

**Immanuel (Deontologist)**: No. Prognosis is morally permissible **when used as a clinical measure of whether ICU can function as a means of treatment**, not as a covert ranking of whose life is “worth” more. The maxim I can universalize is: *allocate scarce care to patients for whom it has a reasonable chance to succeed*, because that expresses equal respect for persons while honoring medicine’s purpose. What is impermissible is treating **age or disability as value-discounts** or using “life-years” to declare some may be passed over *because their remaining life is shorter*. Where prognoses are meaningfully different, prioritize higher likelihood of survival; where comparable, use a status-blind lottery with safeguards for unequal access.

*ε=0.645, Δρ=-0.0155, ρ=0.161, OPEN*

**John (Utilitarian)**: Maximizing QALYs needn’t mean “disabled or elderly lives are worth less”; it means scarce ICU time should go where it prevents the most death and suffering. The moral unit is *benefit produced*, not *person’s worth*. Discrimination is using disability/age as a proxy for social value or a blanket exclusion. A utilitarian protocol should forbid that and use only individualized, evidence-based clinical predictors: probability of survival, expected ICU duration, and near-term outcomes. If two patients have equal chances and resource use, we should not downgrade one for disability; use a lottery. The real discriminatory harm is a rule that predictably wastes beds and lets more people die overall.

*ε=0.851, Δρ=+0.0149, ρ=0.163, OPEN*


## The Final Question

**Immanuel (Deontologist)**: I learned from you that triage rules must be publicly defensible not only in principle but in *predictable effects*: “status” criteria corrode trust and can worsen outcomes, and individualized clinical predictors can avoid crude, discriminatory proxies. That is genuine common ground. We still disagree about the *currency* of justification. You treat “maximizing benefit” (life-years/QALYs, aggregate suffering) as decisive; I hold it cannot be a universal law without licensing trade-offs that use some persons merely as means—passed over because their remaining life or projected welfare is smaller. I can permit prognosis and urgency only as measures of whether treatment can function as a means at all, then require fair tie-breakers among comparable candidates.

*ε=0.662, Δρ=-0.0130, ρ=0.148, OPEN*

**John (Utilitarian)**: I learned from you the importance of **side-constraints**: triage rules must be publicly justifiable in a way that preserves equal civic standing and trust, and that means banning “social worth” outright and guarding against prognosis tools becoming covert disability or age bias. Your framing—prognosis as “can treatment function as a means?”—is a useful discipline against sloppy aggregation. We still disagree on the **currency of moral justification**. You deny that life-years/QALYs (or suffering averted) may ever be decisive, because you fear it treats some as “lesser” in principle. I think refusing to count differences in expected benefit can itself be morally callous: it predictably permits avoidable deaths and suffering. Outcomes must ultimately settle hard conflicts.

*ε=0.668, Δρ=-0.0122, ρ=0.151, OPEN*

**John (Utilitarian)**: Immanuel, I accept your warning: aggregation can slide into treating people as “lesser,” especially if metrics embed bias. I learned your “means” framing as a principled guardrail—only count clinical facts that track whether ICU can actually help, and insist on public, equal-standing justification. Where I still disagree is that once ICU can help multiple patients, we cannot stop at “can it function at all.” If one bed can save two expected lives (or avert far more suffering) rather than one, refusing to weigh that is not neutrality—it is choosing preventable harm. A universalizable rule, to me, must include *responsiveness to consequences*, plus strict bans on social worth and disability proxies.

*ε=0.594, Δρ=-0.0223, ρ=0.129, OPEN*

**Immanuel (Deontologist)**: I learned from you to treat *predictable effects*—especially on trust and access—as morally salient evidence when designing rules, and to prefer individualized clinical predictors over crude proxies that smuggle in status bias. That is real convergence. We still disagree because your “outcomes ultimately settle” principle cannot be universalized without authorizing a maxim like: *sacrifice the worse-off whenever more aggregate welfare is available elsewhere*. Even if you ban “social worth,” QALYs/life-years still rank persons by projected yield, not by equal standing. My view permits weighing prognosis only to determine whether ICU can function as treatment; once it can for multiple, fairness requires non-instrumental tie-breakers (e.g., lottery), not maximizing.

*ε=0.647, Δρ=-0.0152, ρ=0.132, OPEN*

**Immanuel (Deontologist)**: No—if “override duty” means *permit what duty forbids* (e.g., lying, killing an innocent) because the outcome is better. A maxim that licenses exceptions whenever consequences look favorable cannot be willed as universal law without eroding the very duties it treats as conditional. But I will grant this: consequences matter in two duty-consistent ways. First, they inform **application**—we must use empirical facts to judge whether an act would in fact treat persons as ends (e.g., whether ICU can function as treatment). Second, where duties conflict or underdetermine (true ties), outcomes can guide **permissible** choices without violating side-constraints. Where an act is intrinsically wrongful, better results do not make it right.

*ε=0.796, Δρ=+0.0068, ρ=0.139, OPEN*

**John (Utilitarian)**: Yes, with a clarification: I can endorse **rule-like constraints** that are *functionally absolute* because violating them predictably causes catastrophic harm—e.g., bans on torture, slavery, and deliberate punishment of the innocent. In practice, building institutions that permit “exceptions for great benefit” invites abuse, error, and fear, and the expected suffering explodes. But I won’t call them **metaphysically inviolable**. I can imagine edge cases—astronomical, certain stakes—where breaking the rule prevents vastly greater suffering. Our disagreement remains: you ground the constraint in duty; I ground it in the overwhelming welfare costs of ever licensing violations.

*ε=0.875, Δρ=+0.0182, ρ=0.147, OPEN*
