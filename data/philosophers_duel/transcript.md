## The Classic Trolley

**Immanuel (Deontologist)**: I would pull the lever, but not because “one is better than five.” The moral question is whether my maxim could be universal law while still respecting persons as ends. Here, I am not *using* the one worker as a means; I am redirecting a threat I did not create, aiming to minimize rights-violations while acting under a duty to aid when I can without committing murder. A universalizable maxim is: “When an unavoidable harm will occur, and no one is targeted as a means, divert to the track where fewer are killed.” Still, John is right to press that this resembles weighing lives; the key distinction is intention and means, not aggregate welfare.

*ε=0.980, Δρ=+0.0312, ρ=0.231, OPEN*

**John (Utilitarian)**: Yes: pull the lever. On the facts given, diverting the trolley prevents four additional deaths, and that reduction in suffering and lost welfare is morally decisive. If we treat everyone’s interests impartially, allowing five to die when you can save them at the cost of one is a worse outcome you could reasonably have prevented. Immanuel is right that “using someone as a means” matters morally to many people, and that intention can corrupt agents. But in this case the causal structure is simple: either one dies or five die, and your choice affects which world occurs. Refusing to act is still a choice with foreseeable consequences, and it predictably permits the greater harm.

*ε=0.991, Δρ=+0.0324, ρ=0.212, OPEN*

**John (Utilitarian)**: Pulling the lever is justified because it minimizes preventable catastrophe: four additional lives, with all the attendant suffering and lost welfare, are saved. I appreciate your attempt to ground this in a universalizable maxim, and I agree the “means” distinction tracks an important moral intuition—rules against treating persons as tools usually promote trust and security. But that is precisely why outcomes must anchor the justification: if the same structure recurred with numbers reversed, your principle would still instruct diversion, and it would be perverse to deny that “fewer killed” is doing the real work. Intentions matter instrumentally; here, the decisive fact is the difference in harm.

*ε=0.853, Δρ=+0.0151, ρ=0.227, OPEN*

**Immanuel (Deontologist)**: Your impartial concern for welfare is morally serious; yet you make outcomes *decisive*, and that licenses what cannot be willed as universal law. If the maxim is “kill one whenever more can be saved,” then each person may be sacrificed whenever beneficial—treating persons as mere instruments. My justification for pulling the lever is narrower: I may permissibly redirect an existing threat to minimize rights-violation **only if** I neither intend anyone’s death as a means nor adopt a principle of trade-offs. Omissions can be culpable, yes; but culpability tracks duties, not arithmetic. The moral constraint is: never choose someone’s death *as the method* for saving others.

*ε=0.830, Δρ=+0.0119, ρ=0.243, OPEN*

**Immanuel (Deontologist)**: Not necessarily. Treating someone as a mere means involves making their death the *instrument* of your plan—using them as a tool (as in pushing a person to stop the trolley). In the lever case, the one’s death is a foreseen side-effect of redirecting an existing threat, not the means by which the five are saved; what saves the five is the trolley’s absence from their track, not the one’s impact. Still, the dignity worry has force: you do intentionally choose a track knowing a person stands there. That is why the permission must be narrow: only when harm is unavoidable, you do not *aim* at anyone’s death, and you act under a duty to prevent wrongful killing without adopting a maxim of “sacrifice whenever beneficial.”

*ε=0.748, Δρ=-0.0003, ρ=0.243, OPEN*

**John (Utilitarian)**: No—I would pull the lever precisely because “keeping my hands clean” is not the point; preventing avoidable catastrophe is. If I can foresee that inaction leaves five dead when action leaves one dead, then refusing to act is not moral neutrality; it is a choice with predictably worse consequences. Your “means vs side-effect” distinction captures an important safeguard—social trust and security often depend on strong prohibitions. But in this case the policy that best respects persons *in practice* is the one that minimizes preventable deaths. Dignity matters; yet dignity is not honored by allowing four extra families to be bereaved when that cost can be averted.

*ε=0.714, Δρ=-0.0054, ρ=0.222, OPEN*


## The Footbridge

**Immanuel (Deontologist)**: No: you must not push him. Pushing makes his death the *means* by which you save the five; your maxim would be “I may kill an innocent person as an instrument to prevent greater harm.” Universalized, this authorizes everyone to treat others as disposable tools whenever a net benefit is predicted—contradicting respect for persons as ends. Yes, it differs from the lever case. There, you redirect an existing threat; the one’s death is a foreseen side-effect of diversion, not the mechanism of rescue. In Footbridge, your agency targets a person’s body as the brake. Outcomes matter, but they do not license murder.

*ε=0.661, Δρ=-0.0131, ρ=0.230, OPEN*

**John (Utilitarian)**: Yes, you should push him—given the stipulated facts that pushing saves five at the cost of one. From an impartial welfare perspective, the difference between one death and five is morally decisive: allowing four additional deaths to “avoid using someone” is a preventable increase in suffering, grief, and lost life. It *is* different from the lever case psychologically and socially: pushing is more direct, more personal, and a rule permitting it could erode trust. Those are real consequences and must be weighed. But if we hold the scenario fixed—no wider spillovers—the morally relevant feature is the outcome: five live rather than one. The “means vs side-effect” distinction tracks intuitions, not welfare.

*ε=0.644, Δρ=-0.0156, ρ=0.206, OPEN*

**John (Utilitarian)**: Your “means” constraint captures something instrumentally vital: societies that permit deliberate killing as a tool risk terror, mistrust, and long-run suffering. A utilitarian must count that. But in the stipulated footbridge case, those broader spillovers are bracketed; what remains is five deaths versus one. If I refuse to push to preserve a purity about agency, I am effectively choosing the outcome where four additional people die—foreseeably and preventably. Moreover, “universalize” cuts both ways: a rule forbidding rescue whenever it requires using force against one person also licenses avoidable catastrophe. The morally relevant question is which principle, in practice, minimizes wrongful death and anguish overall.

*ε=0.659, Δρ=-0.0134, ρ=0.193, OPEN*

**Immanuel (Deontologist)**: Even “bracketing spillovers,” you ask me to will a maxim: *kill an innocent as a tool when doing so saves more.* Universalized, that makes each person conditionally disposable whenever others’ welfare is higher—contradicting the equal dignity that grounds rights at all. Your calculus treats the man’s life as commensurable currency; mine forbids making him the *means* of rescue. This is not mere squeamishness. In Footbridge, his death is your plan’s instrument; you intentionally deploy his body as a brake. In the lever case, you redirect an existing threat; the one’s death is foreseen, not selected as the method. We have duties to aid, but not by committing murder.

*ε=0.640, Δρ=-0.0161, ρ=0.214, OPEN*

**Immanuel (Deontologist)**: I do not “justify” their deaths as acceptable; I deny that I may commit murder to prevent them. My duty is twofold: to aid others in peril *and* to respect each person as an end. In Footbridge, saving the five requires adopting the maxim: “I may intentionally kill an innocent as a means when doing so benefits more.” Universalized, that makes everyone conditionally disposable—undermining the very equal standing that grounds any duty of aid. The five deaths are a tragedy I must try to prevent by permissible means (warning, stopping the trolley, etc.). But when the only available “rescue” is to use a person as a tool, the act is forbidden. This is precisely why it differs from the lever case.

*ε=0.531, Δρ=-0.0299, ρ=0.184, OPEN*

**John (Utilitarian)**: No—my view isn’t grounded in squeamishness. In the *stipulated* cases, both are morally alike in their core fact: choosing the option that foreseeably leaves one dead rather than five minimizes harm. They differ in two consequential ways, though. First, *reliability and knowledge*: pushing a man is a cruder, more uncertain intervention than flipping a switch; uncertainty raises expected harm. Second, *rule and social effects*: a public norm permitting intentional pushing/using bodies as brakes is far more likely to erode trust, invite abuse, and increase long‑run suffering than a norm permitting track-switching in emergencies. So: same basic utilitarian logic, but potentially different total expected consequences.

*ε=0.577, Δρ=-0.0245, ρ=0.169, OPEN*


## The Transplant Surgeon

**Immanuel (Deontologist)**: No. To harvest is to adopt the maxim: “I may kill an innocent person as a means to save more.” Universalized, that authorizes everyone to treat others as spare parts whenever a net benefit is predicted—contradicting the equal status of persons as ends in themselves, and collapsing the very idea of a right not to be killed. This differs from most trolley “lever” cases because switching tracks redirects an existing threat; the one death can be a foreseen side‑effect of diversion, not the intended mechanism of rescue. Transplant (like Footbridge) makes the victim’s death the instrument: their body is deliberately used as the resource by which the five are saved. That is murder, not rescue.

*ε=0.673, Δρ=-0.0114, ρ=0.172, OPEN*

**John (Utilitarian)**: Yes—*if* we truly stipulate away spillovers (no detection, no fear, no institutional corruption) and the probabilities are clear: saving five at the cost of one minimizes death and suffering. But that stipulation is exactly why Transplant differs from trolley. In real life, a policy or precedent of doctors killing for organs would predictably destroy trust, reduce people seeking care, invite abuse, and thereby cause far more harm than it prevents. By contrast, emergency track-switching can be tightly circumscribed and is less corrosive to core social roles. So: act-utilitarianism says “harvest” in the artificial case; rule/real-world utilitarianism says “don’t,” because the long-run consequences are catastrophic.

*ε=0.640, Δρ=-0.0161, ρ=0.152, OPEN*

**John (Utilitarian)**: Your “universalized spare parts” worry is a powerful *consequential* objection: in any real medical system, permitting organ-harvesting killings would predictably annihilate trust, deter care, invite coercion, and increase deaths—so a utilitarian rule forbids it. But notice that this is not duty versus outcome; it’s an argument about *which norms minimize harm*. In the purified thought experiment where those spillovers truly don’t exist and probabilities are known, the moral residue is five avoidable deaths versus one. Calling the one “a means” doesn’t itself settle it—what matters is the expected suffering prevented. Trolley differs mainly because the institutional/role consequences of surgeons-as-killers are far worse than emergency diversion.

*ε=0.526, Δρ=-0.0305, ρ=0.122, OPEN*

**Immanuel (Deontologist)**: Even granting your “no spillovers” purification, the act remains impermissible: you propose a maxim of *intentional killing of an innocent as a means* to others’ benefit. Universalized, it annihilates the right not to be killed, because anyone becomes permissibly disposable whenever a net gain is forecast. That contradiction is not empirical; it is conceptual—rights cannot be conditional on utility without ceasing to be rights. Your appeal to rule-utilitarianism concedes my core point: you need a constraint that functions like a duty. I ground it directly in respect for persons as ends. Hence Transplant (like Footbridge) is murder-as-instrument; the lever case is diversion of a threat, not use of a person as a tool.

*ε=0.554, Δρ=-0.0273, ρ=0.145, OPEN*

**Immanuel (Deontologist)**: What is “special” is not the *method* as mere mechanics, but the maxim the method embodies. In Transplant (and Footbridge), the plan is: **intentionally kill an innocent person as a means**—their death and body are the instrument by which the five live. That violates a perfect duty not to murder and fails the Formula of Humanity: it treats a person as a mere resource. In the standard lever case, by contrast, you **redirect an existing threat**; the one death is a foreseen side‑effect of diversion, not the means you employ. Outcomes matter, but duty constrains what may be done to persons.

*ε=0.698, Δρ=-0.0078, ρ=0.137, OPEN*

**John (Utilitarian)**: A rule can be causally implicated without being morally culpable in the same way. The utilitarian question is: which rule, as a publicly known practice, minimizes *expected* harm given human incentives and institutions? A “license to kill the healthy when it saves five” would predictably: (i) collapse trust in medicine, (ii) deter checkups and organ donation, (iii) invite error and abuse, and (iv) shift doctors from healers to threats—raising deaths far beyond the five. So the *rule permitting harvest* is responsible for far more death in expectation. In the purified no-spillover fantasy, yes: refusing harvest “costs” five. In the real world, the anti-killing rule saves more lives overall.

*ε=0.581, Δρ=-0.0239, ρ=0.098, OPEN*


## The Triage Protocol

**Immanuel (Deontologist)**: Allocate beds by a **public, universalizable triage rule** that respects each patient as an end, not as a bearer of “greater social value.” Permissible factors are those tied to the **clinical task** of medicine: (1) **medical urgency** and **likelihood of benefit** from ICU *as a way of using scarce means responsibly*, (2) **expected ICU duration** only insofar as it reflects treatability (not “worth”), and (3) **equal-status tie‑breakers** (lottery or first-come, constrained to prevent unfair access advantages). Impermissible factors: **social status**, wealth, “importance,” and **disability/age as such**. Age may enter only as a **prognostic marker** when it genuinely tracks response to treatment, never as a judgment that older lives count for less.

*ε=0.974, Δρ=+0.0305, ρ=0.168, OPEN*

**John (Utilitarian)**: Allocate ICU beds to maximize expected lives saved and suffering averted under a rule the public can accept and clinicians can apply. So we should prioritize: (1) **likelihood of survival with ICU** (expected benefit), (2) **urgency** (who will die without it soonest), and (3) **expected ICU duration** insofar as shorter courses let us save more patients overall. Use **lottery** only among roughly equal prognoses. Morally impermissible: **wealth, social status, fame, race, gender**, or “social worth.” **Age and disability** are permissible **only indirectly** as clinically relevant prognostic indicators (e.g., frailty affecting survival), never as “lesser value” lives. This largely converges with Immanuel’s constraints—my justification is outcome-based: these rules minimize total harm and avoid corrosive injustice and mistrust.

*ε=0.876, Δρ=+0.0183, ρ=0.116, OPEN*

**John (Utilitarian)**: We largely converge on the *policy*, but I reject the grounding. “Respect as ends” is best operationalized by rules that **minimize preventable death and suffering** while preserving trust. That’s why urgency, likelihood of benefit, and ICU duration matter: not because some lives are “worth more,” but because each bed misallocated predictably costs additional lives. Where I’d press you: when prognoses differ sharply, a lottery can be a moral mistake—fairness between claimants shouldn’t outweigh **saving more people**. And on age/disability: agree they’re impermissible as rank-ordering “value,” yet we must allow any factor that robustly predicts benefit, or we silently choose avoidable deaths.

*ε=0.605, Δρ=-0.0208, ρ=0.096, OPEN*

**Immanuel (Deontologist)**: Your policy is close to mine, but your *grounding* threatens to smuggle in impermissible rankings. If “maximize lives saved” is the master principle, then whenever excluding a trait (age, disability, even “social role”) would predictably reduce totals, your view has no internal bar against using it—only contingent worries about backlash. My constraint is categorical: persons are not resources to be optimized. Thus: prognosis and urgency are permissible *because they specify competent medical aid under scarcity*, not because they aggregate welfare. “ICU duration” is permissible only as a clinical proxy for treatability, not a direct efficiency metric. Where prognoses are comparable, a lottery is not a mistake but the public expression of equal moral status.

*ε=0.662, Δρ=-0.0130, ρ=0.155, OPEN*

**Immanuel (Deontologist)**: No. Prognosis is *permissible* to use when it tracks the patient’s **medical response to ICU**—that is part of the clinician’s duty to deploy scarce means competently. The constraint is: you may not treat **age (or disability) as such** as a reason to discount a person’s claim. If age correlates with prognosis, you may consider the *prognostic features* (frailty, organ failure, comorbidities) insofar as they bear on benefit—without adopting the maxim “the old are less worth saving.” Randomization enters only when claimants are **clinically comparable**; then a lottery expresses equal moral status rather than sacrificing lives to “fairness.”

*ε=0.703, Δρ=-0.0070, ρ=0.148, OPEN*

**John (Utilitarian)**: Maximizing welfare doesn’t require saying anyone’s life is “worth less.” The non‑discriminatory utilitarian rule is: allocate beds by **expected medical benefit from ICU** (survival gain and suffering averted), using **individualized clinical predictors** (organ failure, frailty indices, comorbid burden), not crude labels like “disabled” or “old.” QALYs become discriminatory when they **bake in lower quality weights for disability** or treat age as a proxy for value; I reject that. Use QALYs, if at all, only to capture *duration of survival benefit* under a public rule that forbids social worth and protects trust. When prognoses are genuinely comparable, use a lottery.

*ε=0.716, Δρ=-0.0051, ρ=0.091, OPEN*


## The Final Question

**Immanuel (Deontologist)**: I learned that your utilitarianism can be more disciplined than its caricature: you accept robust side‑constraints (no wealth, fame, race; no “social worth”) and you treat disability/age only via individualized clinical predictors. That convergence matters for real policy. We still disagree at the foundation. You treat “maximize preventable death and suffering” as master, with constraints justified largely by trust and second‑order effects. I hold a categorical bar: a triage maxim must be universalizable *without* converting persons into instruments for aggregate benefit. Hence my insistence that ICU duration counts only as a treatability proxy, not sheer throughput, and that lotteries among comparable claims are not optional “fairness,” but the public recognition of equal moral status.

*ε=0.625, Δρ=-0.0182, ρ=0.129, OPEN*

**John (Utilitarian)**: I learned your strongest point is not “ignore outcomes,” but that *publicly articulable* principles—like the equal status expressed by a lottery among clinically comparable patients—do moral work beyond mere optics. That pushes utilitarians like me to be clearer about which constraints are non-negotiable in any stable, humane system. We still disagree about grounding and about edge cases. I think the ultimate test is preventable death and suffering: if using ICU duration as a throughput factor (not just a proxy) reliably saves more lives without discriminatory labels, it can be justified. You treat that as a category mistake—too close to treating persons as units of production. I see it as refusing to let avoidable deaths occur when a principled, non-stigmatizing rule can prevent them.

*ε=0.609, Δρ=-0.0204, ρ=0.070, OPEN*

**John (Utilitarian)**: I learned your key contribution is that *public justification* is not cosmetic: principles like lotteries among clinically comparable patients can express equal status and stabilize legitimacy. That matters because legitimacy itself affects welfare (compliance, trust, willingness to seek care). Where I still disagree is your categorical bar against “throughput” reasoning. If two patients have equal expected survival probability *per bed*, but one predictably occupies the ICU three times longer, ignoring duration foreseeably costs additional deaths. To me, refusing that information risks treating future, unseen patients as morally negligible. I accept strict prohibitions on social worth and crude traits, but I cannot accept a rule that knowingly allows preventable deaths when a non-stigmatizing efficiency criterion can avert them.

*ε=0.545, Δρ=-0.0283, ρ=0.042, OPEN*

**Immanuel (Deontologist)**: I learned from you that “public justification” can be defended within utilitarianism not merely as expedience but as a structural requirement for a humane system; that narrows the gap in practice. Yet we still disagree at the decisive point: you would license ICU duration as a direct throughput maxim if it saves more lives. I cannot universalize the maxim “prefer those who consume fewer resources” without making persons’ claims conditional on their efficiency for others’ benefit—treating them as means. Future patients matter, but they do not generate a permission to discount the equal claim of a present, clinically comparable person. Where benefit is comparable, the lottery is not optional; it is the owed expression of equal status.

*ε=0.628, Δρ=-0.0177, ρ=0.112, OPEN*

**Immanuel (Deontologist)**: No—if “override duty” means: a good enough outcome can make an intrinsically impermissible maxim permissible. If I may lie, kill an innocent, or allocate care by a rule I cannot will as universal law *because* it would save more lives, then duty has been reduced to an instrument. What I will concede is narrower: (1) consequences matter **within** duty when they specify what competent beneficence requires (e.g., prognosis as medical responsiveness), and (2) in genuine moral dilemmas we may face “dirty hands,” where any option violates some duty—but the residue is guilt, not moral permission.

*ε=0.771, Δρ=+0.0032, ρ=0.115, OPEN*

**John (Utilitarian)**: Yes—with a utilitarian rationale, not a deontic one. I accept *rule-level* constraints that should be treated as effectively inviolable because violating them predictably unleashes catastrophic harm and destroys the conditions of welfare itself: e.g., prohibitions on torture, rape, slavery, and punishment of the innocent; and strict bans on triage by “social worth,” race, wealth, or disability status. Could I imagine bizarre thought-experiments where breaking them yields net benefit? Perhaps. But in the real epistemic world—bias, abuse, precedent, strategic misuse—the expected disutility of permitting “exceptions” is so high that the welfare-maximizing policy is: no exceptions. Where we still differ is grounding: I defend these constraints by their systemic consequences, not by intrinsic wrongness.

*ε=0.842, Δρ=+0.0136, ρ=0.055, OPEN*
