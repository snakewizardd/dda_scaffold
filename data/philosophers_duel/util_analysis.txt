EVOLUTION SUMMARY
======================================================================

Prediction Error (eps):
  Start: 0.981
  End:   0.875
  Mean:  0.742
  Std:   0.175

Rigidity (rho):
  Start: 0.211
  End:   0.147
  Min:   0.089
  Max:   0.211

Identity Alignment (cos with identity):
  Start: 0.519
  End:   0.422
  Mean:  0.437
  Std:   0.087

Wound Activations: 3 / 15 turns

Final identity drift: 0.3995

======================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
======================================================================

1. IDENTITY RETENTION:
   Mean cos(identity, response) = 0.437 < 0.5
   -> Identity alignment weakened over debate

2. RIGIDITY MODULATION:
   rho varied from 0.089 to 0.211
   -> DDA actively modulated rigidity in response to surprise (std=0.032)

3. WOUND MECHANICS:
   3 wound activations detected
   - Turn 12: wound_resonance=0.308
   - Turn 24: wound_resonance=0.296
   - Turn 30: wound_resonance=0.254

======================================================================
CONCLUSION: Did DDA retain personality? Did LLM reflect it?
