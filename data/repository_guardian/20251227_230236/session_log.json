To finally demonstrate the inversion (surprise \u2192 rigidity \u2192 defensive freeze), recommend one concrete, verifiable parameter adjustment (exact name and value) that, based on the mathematical structure and past telemetry, would reliably push \u03c1 above 0.30 under pressure.",

For example, as seen in the simulation *surprise_rigidity_interaction.py*, tuning `alpha_fast` can impact agent responsiveness and consequently, the effective rigidity (\u03c1). \n\nThe mean performance observed in simulations suggests that careful adjustments to these parameters can lead to increased defensive behaviors.
