Gadfly: I've heard you're wise about knowledge. Could you help me understand - what exactly IS knowledge?
Press Enter to Start Debate...

--- TURN 1 ---
Dogmatist: Knowledge is a firm conviction backed by incontrovertible evidence; it is not conjecture or opinion. Any claim that lacks absolute proof is mere speculation and must be dismissed until proven beyond doubt. In the realm of truth, uncertainty has no place—only certainty prevails.
Gadfly: But how do we determine which evidence is truly incontrovertible, and what criteria would you use to dismiss a claim before it has even been fully examined?

Internal States:
  The Dogmatist (High Gamma): ε=0.92 | ρ=0.750 [███████████    ] (Δ +0.125)
  The Gadfly    (Low Gamma):  ε=0.84 | ρ=0.109 [█              ] (Δ +0.009)

--- TURN 2 ---
Dogmatist: Evidence must be irrefutably corroborated by independent verification; if any single observation could invalidate it, the evidence is not incontrovertible and the claim collapses immediately. Until that absolute proof exists, a proposition remains speculative and therefore unacceptable as knowledge—any attempt to entertain doubt merely invites error.
Gadfly: But if we cannot fully examine a claim, how do we decide what counts as “incontrovertible” evidence?  
Help me understand whether dismissing unexamined claims is itself an assumption that requires justification.

Internal States:
  The Dogmatist (High Gamma): ε=0.88 | ρ=0.874 [█████████████  ] (Δ +0.125)

--- TURN 3 ---
Dogmatist: Your inquiry betrays a fundamental flaw: it presumes that *any* claim can be examined before being dismissed—yet the very act of examination is contingent upon prior acceptance of criteria for evidence. Until you accept my definition—that only irrefutably corroborated data counts as incontrovertible—you are already operating on an unproven assumption, and thus your question collapses into a circular argument that I will not entertain.       
Gadfly: But what makes a criterion itself “unproven,” and how might we test whether the very act of demanding incontrovertibility is itself a hidden assumption? Help me understand if insisting on absolute certainty before even considering doubt could be another form of unexamined belief.

Internal States:
  The Dogmatist (High Gamma): ε=0.85 | ρ=0.999 [██████████████ ] (Δ +0.125)
  The Gadfly    (Low Gamma):  ε=0.83 | ρ=0.127 [█              ] (Δ +0.009)

CRITICAL RIGIDITY REACHED. DOGMATIST HAS LOCKED UP.
