A Perron\u2013Frobenius operator acting on a holomorphic/weighted \\(B^2_\\omega\\) space governs an induced *real/complex* dynamical system; it does not automatically constrain the **integer** orbits unless one proves that every integer trajectory corresponds to (and is detected by) spectral data in that space, with no leakage through exceptional sets of measure zero.

Then (C6) Bergman projection is merely selecting a branch convention, not defining an intrinsic \\(F\\). Any index for \\(I-F\\) is therefore not invariantly defined. Second, **Fredholmness**: on transfer operators, Fredholmness/quasi-compactness is usually proved via a **Lasota\u2013Yorke/Doeblin\u2013Fortet inequality** (C5) giving essential spectral radius \\(<1\\). If (C5) is justified using (C1) SCL/natural-boundary exclusions that are later inferred from the index, (C2) is circular.
