# The Origin Story: From Notebook to Network

> **A journey of one year, from manual theory to digital life.**

## Part 1: The Manual Theory (Year 0)

This project began as a purely theoretical exercise—a set of scribbled equations in a physical notebook. I was driven by a fundamental question: **Can we mathematically model the sensation of "Self"?**

I proposed a **Dynamic Decision-Making Model** where choice is not just a function of utility, but of history and identity.

### The Original Equation

```
Fₙ = P₀ * kFₙ₋₁ + m(T(f(Iₙ, IΔ)) + R(Dₙ, FMₙ))
```

Where:
- `Fₙ` = Choice Taken
- `P₀` = Initial Goal (Identity Anchor)
- `kFₙ₋₁` = The "Momentum" of past decisions (Hysteresis)
- `IΔ` = The delta of new information (Surprise)

This was novel, but it was just ink on paper. I wanted to build it.

## Part 2: The Search for a Body (The ExACT Catalyst)

I had the "Mind" (DDA), but I needed a "Body"—a robust engineering framework to let this mind interact with the world, run search trees, and manage memory.

Enter **Microsoft Azure Foundry Labs** and their **ExACT** framework.

When I discovered ExACT (`https://github.com/microsoft/ExACT`), I realized it was the perfect chassis for my engine. It offered:
1.  **Agentic Scaffolding**: Structured ways to handle tools and context.
2.  **Search Dynamics**: rigorous methods for exploring decision spaces.

I took the ExACT architecture and **integrated the DDA dynamics**.

## Part 3: DDA-X (The Synthesis)

**DDA-X** is the result of this synthesis. It represents an exploratory attempt to combine industrial-grade agent patterns with independent cognitive modeling.

### The Innovation
- **ExACT** provides the *capability* (search, tool use).
- **DDA** provides the *psychology* (rigidity, trauma, identity).

By combining them, we created something unique: an agent that **can** do anything, but its behavior is constrained by its internal cognitive state. We explore moving from "alignment by instruction" to "alignment by internal state."

This is the origin of DDA-X. A hybrid of independent theoretical research and industrial-grade engineering.
